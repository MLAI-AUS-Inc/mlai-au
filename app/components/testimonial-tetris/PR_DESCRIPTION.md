# PR: Add Interactive Testimonial Tetris Game

## 📋 Summary
Transforms the testimonial section into an interactive Tetris game. Testimonials fall as Tetris pieces, visitors can play the game while discovering community feedback, and click blocks to read full testimonials.

**Status:** ✅ Fully functional and tested  
**Complexity:** High (Tetris game logic + testimonial integration)

---

## 🎯 What's Changed

### New Feature: Testimonial Tetris
- Complete Tetris gameplay in the testimonial section
- Testimonials represented as falling colored blocks
- Click any block to view full testimonial in modal
- Keyboard controls (desktop) + touch buttons (mobile)
- Auto-pause when scrolled off-screen
- Line clearing with animation
- Game over screen with stats

### Files Modified
- `app/routes/home.tsx` - Replaced static TetrisTestimonials with interactive TestimonialTetris

---

## 🎮 Game Design

### Tetris Mechanics
- **Grid**: 10 columns × 20 rows
- **Pieces**: 4 shapes (I, O, T, L) - simplified from classic 7
- **Controls**:
  - Desktop: Arrow keys (move/rotate), Space (rotate), Down (hard drop)
  - Mobile: On-screen touch buttons
- **Line Clearing**: Full rows clear with flash animation
- **Falling**: Timer-based (800ms per cell)

### Testimonial Integration
- **"Now Dropping" Panel**: Shows current falling testimonial with avatar
- **Colored Blocks**: Each testimonial has signature color from site palette
- **Click-to-View**: Click any locked block → modal with full testimonial
- **Readable**: Testimonial text shown in panel, not tiny on blocks

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Why Simplified (4 Shapes)?
- **Faster Development**: Less rotation logic
- **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler collision detection
- **Still Fun**: Provides gameplay variety
- **Focus**: Emphasis on testimonials, not complex Tetris

### Why Canvas?
- **Performance**: Efficient grid rendering
- **Smooth**: Handles animations well
- **Scalable**: Auto-resizes to container
- **Hit Detection**: Easy click-to-view implementation

### Why Auto-Start?
- **Ambient**: Matches site's interactive philosophy (like Logo Shooter)
- **Discovery**: Users naturally discover they can play
- **Engagement**: Immediate visual interest

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **React Router v7** + **TypeScript**
- **HTML5 Canvas 2D** (no additional dependencies)
- **Custom React Hooks** for game state
- **IntersectionObserver** for auto-pause

### Performance
- **Canvas Rendering**: ~60fps on modern devices
- **Auto-Pause**: Stops when off-screen (saves CPU)
- **Minimal Re-renders**: Optimized with useCallback
- **Low Memory**: Efficient grid state management

### Responsive Design
- Canvas auto-scales to container
- Mobile controls appear on small screens
- Touch-optimized buttons
- Works 320px - 4K displays
