## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Core Logic

**Grid System**: 18 columns × 8 rows (wider horizontal layout)  
**Auto-Sizing**: Blocks automatically size based on text length (80, 150, 250, 350 char thresholds)  
**Rotation**: Simplified 90° rotation by swapping width/height (rectangles stay rectangular)  
**Wall-Kick**: Automatic position adjustment when rotation would cause collision  
**Collision Detection**: Grid-based with unique piece IDs to prevent merging  
**Smart Line Clearing**: Removes entire testimonial blocks when any part touches cleared row  
**Fall Speed**: 1500ms per drop (slower for larger pieces)  
**Rendering**: DOM-based with TestimonialBlock components (not Canvas)  
**Reduced Motion**: Automatically renders static mosaic when `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is enabled

### Auto-Sizing Formula

```typescript
Text Length → Block Size (width × height)
-----------   --------------------------
< 80 chars  → 2×2 cells (small)
< 150 chars → 3×2 cells (medium)
< 250 chars → 3×3 cells (large)
< 350 chars → 4×3 cells (extra large)
> 350 chars → 4×4 cells (huge)

Decorative blocks: 1×1, 2×1, 1×2 (no text)
```

**How to Adjust**: Edit `calculateDimensions()` function in `testimonialData.ts`:

- Change thresholds (80, 150, 250, 350) to adjust when blocks get bigger
- Change { width, height } values to make blocks wider/taller
- Lower thresholds = blocks get bigger sooner (more text fits)

### Performance Optimizations

- DOM-based rendering with React components
- IntersectionObserver for auto-pause when off-screen
- Flood-fill algorithm to render contiguous blocks as single elements
- Unique piece IDs prevent visual merging of identical testimonials
- Responsive cell sizing based on viewport

### State Management

- Custom React hook (`useGameState`)
- Manages grid, current/next pieces, stats
- Handles all game logic (movement, collision, locking, line clearing)
- Tracks recent testimonials to prevent repetition

## 🎨 Customization

Edit `testimonialData.ts` to configure:

```typescript
export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  GRID_COLS: 18, // Grid width (columns)
  GRID_ROWS: 8, // Grid height (rows)
  CELL_SIZE: 150, // Max cell size in pixels (auto-scales down)
  FALL_SPEED: 1500, // ms per drop
  FAST_FALL_SPEED: 200, // Soft drop speed
  LOCK_DELAY: 500, // Lock delay ms
  BORDER_RADIUS: 20, // Block corner rounding
};
```

**To adjust auto-sizing**, edit the `calculateDimensions()` function:

```typescript
// Make blocks bigger sooner:
if (length < 80) → if (length < 120)  // Blocks get taller earlier

// Make blocks taller:
{ width: 3, height: 2 } → { width: 3, height: 3 }

// General rule:
// - Decrease thresholds = bigger blocks
// - Increase thresholds = smaller, more compact blocks
```

Add/edit testimonials in `BASE_TESTIMONIALS` array (dimensions auto-calculate!).

## 🚀 Usage

Already integrated in `app/routes/home.tsx`:

```tsx
import { TestimonialTetris } from "~/components/testimonial-tetris";

// In component:
<TestimonialTetris />;
```

## 🎯 Game Design Decisions

### Why Simplified Rectangle Rotation?

- **Accessible**: 90° rotation by swapping width/height is intuitive
- **Readable**: Blocks stay rectangular, maintaining testimonial readability
- **Wall-Kick**: Automatic position adjustment prevents frustrating edge cases
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Single rotate button alongside other controls
- **Fulfills Requirements**: Meets bounty requirement for rotation while keeping UX simple

### Why Auto-Sizing Instead of Fixed Shapes?

- **Dynamic**: Automatically adapts to any testimonial length
- **No Manual Config**: Add testimonials without specifying dimensions
- **Variety**: Natural variety based on actual content
- **Maintainable**: Easy to adjust with one formula

### Why DOM Instead of Canvas?

- **Styling**: Leverage TailwindCSS and React components
- **Accessibility**: Native HTML for text content
- **Rich Content**: Easy to display avatars, formatted text
- **Hover/Click**: Native browser interactions
- **Responsive**: CSS handles scaling naturally

### Why Transparent Background?

- **Visual Consistency**: Blocks float on section background
- **Modern Look**: Cleaner, less boxy appearance
- **Focus**: Emphasizes the colorful testimonial blocks

### Why Smart Line Clearing?

- **Testimonial Integrity**: Clears entire blocks, not just cells
- **Visual Coherence**: No partial testimonial fragments
- **Satisfying**: Whole blocks disappear and drop

### Why Reduced Motion Fallback?

- **Accessibility**: Respects user preferences for reduced motion
- **Graceful Degradation**: Static mosaic provides same content without animation
- **Performance**: No game loop or timers when motion is reduced
- **Inclusive**: Ensures all users can access testimonial content

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- **Simplified Rotation**: Only 90° rotation (swaps width/height), not full 360° rotation
- **No Scoring System**: Focus on testimonial reading, not competition
- **No Hold Feature**: Keep controls minimal
- **No Ghost Piece**: Simpler UI

These are intentional design choices to keep the game accessible and focus on the testimonial experience.
