          <h2>How to introduce yourself at a networking event</h2>
          <p>
            Use a clear 10‑second intro that ends with a question. Formula: name + role (or focus) + what you\'re exploring + an easy question. For example: “I\'m Priya—product designer moving into AI safety. I\'m exploring evaluation tools for small teams. What brings you to this meetup?” This keeps things human and opens the floor.
          </p>

            Make your last sentence a low‑pressure question (e.g., “What are you building?”, “Which talk are you here for?”). Questions lower nerves and invite natural conversation.
          </ArticleCallout>

          <h2>Conversation starters that work at tech and AI meetups</h2>
          <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mlai-main-website.firebasestorage.app/o/content-factory%2FU05QPB483K9%2FMLAI-AUS-Inc%2Fmlai-au%2Fimages%2Finline-8777a4e0-86e6-4bc0-a7bb-a6bb87bab79a.jpg?alt=media&token=624d4812-c501-4b3a-b08c-68eee2c149f1" alt="Diverse group of professionals networking at a tech meetup with a nostalgic 90s film aesthetic." className="w-full rounded-lg my-8" />

          <p>
            Keep openers short, specific, and kind. Five that travel well in AU events:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“What\'s the most interesting thing you\'ve heard tonight?”</li>
            <li>“I\'m new to this group—how do people usually use the break time?”</li>
            <li>“I noticed your badge says <em>Geelong</em>; do you work with any local startups?”</li>
            <li>“If someone\'s new to LLMs at work, what\'s a safe first project?”</li>
            <li>“What problem are you hoping to solve with AI this year?”</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Reading the room: open vs closed circles</h3>
          <p>
            Join groups that have a physical “gap” (open triangle) and make brief eye contact before stepping in. Avoid tight, closed circles or 1‑on‑1s that look intense. If you\'re stuck, queue for a drink or snacks—queues create easy micro‑chats.
          </p>

          <h2>If you\'re shy or new: low‑pressure ways to join</h2>
          <img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/mlai-main-website.firebasestorage.app/o/content-factory%2FU05QPB483K9%2FMLAI-AUS-Inc%2Fmlai-au%2Fimages%2Finline-be9809ab-ca93-4437-ac14-3ed94fec8f43.jpg?alt=media&token=308e9e75-f2c3-493f-b1eb-5ad8a03d79fe" alt="Diverse individuals in a 90s tech workspace, fostering connection in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere." className="w-full rounded-lg my-8" />

          <p>
            Start with open groups, speaker lines, or tables with spare seats. Ask practical questions (“Is there a Slack for this group?”, “Where do project posts go?”). Consider volunteering on the door for a future event—you\'ll meet everyone naturally.
          </p>

          <h2>Add value in the moment (without selling)</h2>
          <p>
            Share a pointer or perspective, not a pitch. Examples: “There\'s an AU‑focused repo for that—happy to DM it,” or “We tried something similar; our lesson was to start with a tiny pilot.” Offer to send a link later rather than fishing through your phone on the spot.
          </p>

          <h2>Follow‑up that actually gets replies</h2>
          <p>
            Follow up within 24–48 hours while the chat is fresh. Keep it short, include context, and suggest a tiny next step. Two simple templates:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              LinkedIn DM: “Great to meet at {TOPIC.toLowerCase()} last night—loved your take on evaluation. Here\'s the repo I mentioned. If useful, happy to swap notes on small‑team testing next week.”
            </li>
            <li>
              Email: “Hi [Name]—Sam from the AI meetup at [Venue]. We discussed data labelling. This 3‑step guide helped us avoid scope creep. If you\'re exploring pilots, a 15‑minute call next week could save you time—no pressure.”
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Do\'s and don\'ts (AU context)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Do keep intros short; don\'t hard‑pitch strangers.</li>
            <li>Do ask consent before sharing photos or tagging people.</li>
            <li>Do respect venue and organiser codes of conduct.</li>
            <li>Don\'t dominate a conversation—offer others space to join.</li>
            <li>Do close politely: “Great chatting—shall we connect on LinkedIn and pick this up?”</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Take this plan to your next event</h2>
          <p>
            Prepare your 10‑second intro, arrive with three openers, focus on 3–5 quality chats, and send concise follow‑ups within 48 hours. That\'s it—repeatable, respectful, and effective for Australian AI/tech communities.
