# mlai website

This is the MLAI website - a React Router v7 application for a not-for-profit community based in Australia that aims to empower the Australian AI Community.

## Common advice

Use `bun` instead of `npm` -- `bun run typecheck`, `bun run typegen`

Add new routes to the `routes.ts` file

Read and use [@TODO.md](@file:mlai-au/TODO.md) as your scratchpad to keep track.

You may use commands like `tree -I 'node_modules|public'` to get an overview of the project structure.
